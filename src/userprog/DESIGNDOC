			   ARGUMENT PASSING

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

  None.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

  First, I modify the string in place to get rid of any excess whitespace. Then, I
  parse the string and copy the offsets from the start of the string of each
  argument into an array. The number of strtok_r() calls also gives me argc. Then,
  I backwards through that array to get the address and length of each argument
  and push those onto the stack (in reverse order) while decrementing $esp. While
  I'm doing this, I store the address of $esp for every argument into another
  array ($esp should point to the beginning of each argument on the stack as it
  gets pushed onto the stack). Then, I word-align $esp, push the addresses of all
  of the arguments (in reverse order, again) using my argument address list, push
  argc, and then push a fake return value, all while decrementing $esp
  accordingly. The elements of argv[] are pushed onto the stack in reverse order,
  which is what is expected. I avoid overflowing by checking to make sure the
  argument string isn't too long.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

  The kernel needs to be reentrant. Therefore, it implements strtok_r(), which is
  a reentrant version of strtok().

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

  One advantage is that the kernel code becomes a lot simpler. Since the shell is
  a system application, the separation of the name and arguments is done outside
  the kernel and therefore reduces the number of potential bugs in the kernel.

  Another advantage of the Unix approach is that the shell abstracts away the
  stack setup onto the kernel in a consistent manner, rather than the kernel
  having to do it all by itself.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

  Each file descriptor is an integer, indicating a single file opened by the current
  thread. The file  descriptor starts with 2 (i.e., the first file opened by the
  thread will have file descriptor = 2), because 0 and 1 are reserved for STDIN_FILENO
  and STDOUT_FILENO. Upon openning a new file, allocate a new file descriptor to
  this file, basing on the previous one stored in the thread struct. This file
  descriptor is then used to create a new struct fd_entry, and this fd_entry will
  be added to desc_table.

  With in a single process, file descriptors are unique, thus can be used to
  identify different opened files. Even if the file names are the same, this
  design will dinstinguish between them correctly.

  Advantages:
    Our implementation is pretty straightforward. When openning a new file, our
    code simply just increment the file descriptor and allocate it to the newly
    opened file, create an entry containing information for this file open, and
    add it to the list of file descriptor entries. This implementation did not
    take us too much time. If we implement it in another way so that it can recycle
    the file descriptors for the closed files, we would have to manipulate heap
    memory, which slow both for human coding and machine running.


  Disadvantages:
    Everytime the program opens a file, the file descriptor increments. Even if
    the program closes the file, immediately after openning, the file descriptor
    will never restore to its old value. If the program keeps running without
    exiting, and opens a whole lot of files, integer overflow might occur.



>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

  We did not change it.
